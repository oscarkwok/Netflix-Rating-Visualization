# Netflix-Rating-Visualization

I created a CSV dataset of notable Netflix original content to gather insights on how the content’s features (genre, actors, gender, etc.) affected the ratings that it received from critics and viewers. 
I then utilized Python and its libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to compile the analysis on Jupyter Notebooks.
